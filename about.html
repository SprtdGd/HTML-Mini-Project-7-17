                I'm currently a freelance graphic artist & I mix music as well. Both being 2 of my favorite hobbies, I also make money doing them as well though. I have been doing graphic design for almost 20
                years, but have only been serious about expanding in the field for the last 7. I'm a creative at heart, so I really enjoy it. <a href="http://www.sprtd.com" target="_new" alt="">Click here to visit my port!</a>

                I also mix music! I primarily music for artists, coaches, dance teams, and stage performers all over the US. From stage shows to mashups, I do a little bit of everything. I really love music. My pops was a DJ when he was young, and my mom a singer. So music is in my blood! <a href="https://soundcloud.com/theyump3" target="_new"> Click Here to visit my soundcloud!</a>

                Some of my other favorite hobbies include photography, writing, blogging, reading, cooking, art, dance. If it's creative, i'm probably into it. I am obessed with chicken and tacos, can eat them on a daily basis, no skips!

            <p> I don't really have a favorite sports team to be honest with you. I was on the swim team when I was younger, and martial arts, but I don't know if those apply, and they don't have teams per se. Lol.  I enjoyed the Cowboys and the Titans back when I cared more about football. </p>

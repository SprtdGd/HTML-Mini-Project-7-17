                I have always been a bit of a computer nerd tbh. As soon as I became aware of personal computers, GOODBYE video games! & Ever since the internet came along, i've been attached to
                computers. I put together my first "custom" PC in the 9th grade.

               I was first introduced to coding wayyyy back when with myspace, I just didn't know it yet, lol.
               That is the very first time I was introduced to HTML & CSS. I took what I learned there and began making simple webpages on Yahoo, Geocities, and etc. I didn't really know what I was doing, I just knew which codes to copy and paste. I did get a few freelance jobs building some websites many years ago, but once I realized how quickly things involved in tech I basically didn't have the desire to keep up, and i ended up directing my energy to other things.

                Fast forward to more modern days, I do a lot of freelance graphic design work, and I am constantly asked to design websites as well. Being that it's been over a decade since I'd done any I would always say no. Now i'm back to pick up where I left off, and expand my knowledge and experience.
